%  Description      :
%    The wave data was measured at the Poseidon platform  
%    in the Japan Sea from 24th November 1987 08.12 hours to 25th November 
%    1987 07.57 hours. Poseidon was located 3 km off the coast of Yura 
%    in the Yamagata prefecture, in the Japan Sea during the measurements. 
%    The most important wave components are to some extent influenced by the 
%    water depth of 42 m. The data are measured with three ultrasonic wave 
%    gauges located at the sea floor and the relative coordinates of the 
%    gauges are as follows (x-axis points to the East, y-axis points to 
%    the North):
