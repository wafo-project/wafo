% Description      :
%   The registration of wind speeds at the Gullfaks field 
%   started up on Statfjord A in 1978 and continued until 1990.  
%   The dataregistration was transferred to Gullfaks C in Nov 1989. 
%   Due to some difficulties of the windregistration on Gullfaks C in 
%   the beginning, they continued to use the registered data from 
%   Statfjord A. 
%   The windspeed is measured in  (meter/second), 110 m above mean water 
%   level (MWL) and the wind direction is given in degrees for the data.
%   The data are a mean value of every 10 minutes.
%   Wind directions are defined in the meteorological convention, i.e., 
%   0 degrees = wind approaching from North, 90 degrees = wind from East, etc.
